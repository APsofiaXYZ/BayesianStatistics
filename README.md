### Model of cell-to-cell interaction for analysis of tumor pathology images
**Team members**: Diana Isaeva, Alexandra Pershakova, Maria Vittoria Trussoni



## Abstract
Cancer is a very complex desease characterized by uncontrolled cells growth.
In past studies, it was shown that cell-cell interactions play a vital role in the progression of the methastasis of cancer
But it is hard for pathologists to study those subtle though crucial patterns due to human brain limitations!
Bayesian framework well applies in order to model how the mark in a pattern might have been formed given the points

Our dataset is coming from an *images* dataset of more than 50 images.
In particular, it comes from the dataset of pathology images of lung cancer patients as a result of the National Lung Screening trial from the National Cancer Institute from US.
\
We describe a spatial map of cells using:
1. *(x, y)*: couple of Cartesian spacial coordinates,
1. *z*: mark, associated by our data providers through a CNN classifier trained on years of data collected from ill patients.
\
##### Our goal is to **study the arrangements of cell types associated with the observed cells**, given their locations.
In spatial point pattern analysis, such a problem is called *marking modeling*, which is to study the formulation of the marks z in a pattern, given the points (x, y).

## Code
TBD :)
